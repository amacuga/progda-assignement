# Assignment solution

This repository contains my solution to the Assignment 2019 for the module Programming for Data Analysis at GMIT.
[See here for the instructions](https://github.com/brianmcginley/ProgDA/raw/master/ProgDA_Assignment.pdf)

## My investigation into the numpy.random package

I created a Jupyter notebook, where I investigated the numpy.random package in Python:

* Explained the overall purpose of the package.
* Explained the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
* Explained the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
* Explained the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers

## How to download the repository

1. Go to [Github](https://github.com/amacuga/progda-assignment).
2. Click the "Clone or download" button.
3. Select "Download ZIP".

## How to see my jupyter notebook

1. Make sure you have Python installed- I would recommend installing the free version of Anaconda.
2. Unzip the repository folder.
2. Run cmder or similar tool.
3. In cmder, navigate to the unzipped folder.
4. Run "jupyter notebook".
5. Select "Assignment.ipynb".
