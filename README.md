# Assignment solution

This repository contains my solution to the Assignment 2019 for the module Programming for Data Analysis at GMIT.
[See here for the instructions](https://github.com/brianmcginley/ProgDA/raw/master/ProgDA_Assignment.pdf)

## My investigation into the numpy.random package

I created a Jupyter notebook, where I investigated the numpy.random package in Python:

* Explained the overall purpose of the package.
* Explained the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
* Explained the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
* Explained the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers
